  'After you register at your Gemeinde, your data goes to the cantonal migration office.

You''ll receive a letter which requires a signature upon receipt. Missing the delivery means you''ll have to pick it up at the post office. The letter will to provide an appointment to collect biometric data (fingerprints + photo). Appointments are given usually within the first 1–2 weeks after registration.

After biometrics, the permit card (plastic ID card) is produced by the federal authorities and sent to your Swiss address by registered post.

Processing can take 2–8 weeks depending on canton.

Children also receive a card and are required to provide data at the appointment (no fingerprints for younger kids). 

This card is needed for many admin tasks (opening bank account, long-term housing, some insurances, travel).

Fees: usually around CHF 60 - 150 per adult, depending on the canton and permit type',
