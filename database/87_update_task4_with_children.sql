Kindergarten usually starts at age 4 or 5 and is mandatory in most cantons (2 years before primary school).

Registration happens at your Gemeinde (municipality). They will assign a public school based on your home address (catchment system).

You may also apply to private or international schools, but these require direct application and tuition fees.
